Increasingly, I find myself being asked the question: 

> What resources do you recommend to learn \<insert blockchain topic here\>?

This post will serve as a live list of resources I've come across for a variety of Blockchain topics.

## Smart Contracts

> A smart contract, like any contract, establishes the terms of an agreement. But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract’s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.
